If you're a solo Apple developer, you know the struggle. That brilliant feature idea strikes at 2 AM, so you frantically type it into whatever app is closest. A critical bug surfaces during testing, and you jot it down on a sticky note that promptly disappears. Come release time, you're scrambling to remember what actually shipped.

Your development workflow deserves better than scattered notes and forgotten ideas.



## The Problem with "Making Do"

Most developers cobble together a system from general-purpose tools - Notes app for ideas, Reminders for bugs, maybe a text file for release planning. It works until it doesn't. Ideas get buried in endless note lists. Bug reports lack context by the time you get back to them. Release communications feel rushed and unprofessional.

The result? Wasted mental energy, missed opportunities, and the nagging feeling that you're not operating at your full potential.

## Built for How You Actually Work

Deploy Path recognizes that solo Apple developers have unique needs. You're not managing a team - you're managing ideas, priorities, and the constant flow between inspiration and execution.

**Capture Ideas Where They Belong**: That 3 AM eureka moment gets properly categorized, not lost in a sea of grocery lists and meeting notes.

**Track Bugs With Context**: Log issues the moment you spot them, with all the context fresh in your mind. No more "what was I thinking?" moments weeks later.

**Professional Release Communication**: Transform your scattered work into clean version summaries and beautiful public changelogs that make your users feel informed and valued.

## Designed for Your Devices, Your Life

Whether you're coding deep on your Mac, sketching ideas on your iPad, or capturing thoughts during your iPhone commute, Deploy Path follows your workflow. It's the same professional-grade organization across every Apple device you use.

## Zero Friction, Maximum Focus

Deploy Path strips away the enterprise bloat that clutters most project management tools. No team permissions to configure, no features you'll never touch, no complexity that gets between you and your code.

Just clean, focused organization that helps you build better apps.

## Your Ideas Deserve Better

Every feature that ships started as an idea. Every bug that gets fixed started as a problem worth solving. Deploy Path ensures none of that valuable work gets lost in the shuffle.

Because when you're building the future one app at a time, every idea matters.
