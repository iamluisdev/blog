## Technical Implementation

### Before (Google Analytics + Supabase)
```typescript
// Old implementation used:
// 1. Google Analytics for general site tracking
// 2. Supabase database for storing view counts
// 3. Custom API routes for view counting
// 4. Complex view fetching logic
```

### After (Vercel Analytics Only)
```typescript
// New implementation uses:
// 1. Vercel Analytics for all tracking
// 2. Custom events for blog post views
// 3. Simplified view counter component
// 4. No database dependency for view counting

import { track } from "@vercel/analytics";

// Track page view
track("Page View", {
  slug: slug,
  path: `/${slug}`,
  title: document.title || slug,
});
```

- Additional metadata: slug, path, title
- Accessible in Vercel dashboard under Analytics > Events

### 3. Real-time Dashboard

## Setup for New Projects
